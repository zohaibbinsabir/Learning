Difference between interpreter and compiler

->  Interpreter:    1. Line by line execution
                    2. If there is any error, it will stop execution and show the error
->  Compiler:   1. Compilation of whole program
                2. If there is any error, it will show all the errors at once

->  for example:    1. Python is an interpreter language
                    2. C is a compiler language
                    3. Java is both compiler and interpreter language
                    4. C++ is both compiler and interpreter language

            
->  Python is a high level language
->  C is a middle level language
->  Assembly is a low level language

->  Python is a dynamically typed language
->  C is a statically typed language

->  Python is a platform independent language
->  C is a platform dependent language

->  Python is a general purpose language
->  C is a system programming language

->  Python is a scripting language
->  C is a programming language

->  Python is a functional programming language
->  C is a procedural programming language

->  Python is a object oriented programming language
->  C is a object oriented programming language

How Store Data in Python
we use variables to store data in python
There are 4 types of variables in python
1.  int
2.  float
3.  string
4.  boolean

->  int:    1.  int is used to store integer values
            2.  for example:    1
                                2
                                3
                                4
                                5
                                6
                                7
                                8
                                9
                                10

->  float:  1.  float is used to store decimal values
            2.  for example:    1.1
                                2.2
                                3.3
                                4.4
                                5.5
                                6.6
                                7.7
                                8.8
                                9.9
                                10.10

->  string: 1.  string is used to store text
            2.  for example:    "Hello World"
                                "Hello Python"
                                "Hello Class"
                                "Hello Students"

->  boolean:    1.  boolean is used to store true or false
                2.  for example:    True
                                    False

->  Rules for naming variables:
    1.  variable name should start with a letter or underscore
    2.  variable name should not start with a number
    3.  variable name can only contain alpha numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    4.  variable names are case sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
    5.  variable name should not contain spaces
    6.  variable name should not be a keyword
    7.  variable name should be descriptive

Display output on console:
print("Hello World")

Taking input from user and storing it in a variable:
name = input("Enter your name: ")

user input is always in string format, if you want to convert it into integer or float, you can do it like this:

Taking input from user and converting it into integer:
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

Taking input from user and converting it into float:
salary = float(input("Enter your salary: "))

Taking input from user and converting it into boolean:
isMarried = bool(input("Are you married? "))

check the type of variable:
print(type(name))

Taking input, converting into integer and storing into veriable in one step:
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
